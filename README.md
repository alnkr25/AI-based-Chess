# Ai-based-Chess
AIchess is a Player-Vs-AI chess engine developed using the pygame library. This project allows players to engage in a game of chess against an intelligent computer opponent that autonomously makes its own moves. 
The game's graphical interface, including the chess board and pieces, is implemented using class-based structures and polymorphism, providing an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.
